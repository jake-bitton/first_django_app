Basic Django app where I messed around with admin pages, templates, views and models, and created my own app called "Polls" which, as you might assume, allowed users to generate polls with questions answers, vote counts, publish date etc.
Also learned how to link CSS and HTML template files and overwrite existing default templates in Django and how to link those to a project.

Will be packaging this project so I can learn how to create python/Django packages, I dont really intend for this to see any real use other than as a testing environment for new apps that I may make in the future and as a launch point for my (hopefully more interesting) foray into Django.
